# esp32-flow-sensor
IDT project
An ESP32‑based leak detection demo built with MicroPython. The project monitors pulse signals from a flow sensor to distinguish between normal tap usage and potential leaks. It prints clear status messages (“Tap in use”, “Leak suspected”) to the serial shell for live demonstration.

Features:
• Runs on ESP32 with MicroPython firmware
• Real‑time pulse counting and threshold logic
• Distinguishes between tap usage and leak conditions
• Auto‑runs on reset when saved as 
• Outputs readable status messages for exam/demo presentations
